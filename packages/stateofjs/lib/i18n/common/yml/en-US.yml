      - **ADOPT**: High usage, high satisfaction. Safe technologies to adopt.

      - **AVOID**: Low usage, low satisfaction. Technologies probably best avoided currently.

      - **ANALYZE**: High usage, low satisfaction. Reassess these technologies if you're currently using them.

      This chart shows each technology’s **interest ratio** over its total **user count** (as defined by respondents who are aware of a technology but *haven't* used it yet).
